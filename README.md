# social-network-api

## Description

This project is intended to be an API for a social network web application in which users can share their thoughts, add friends, and react to each others thoughts. This application also utilizies a MongoDB database to store users' information and friends. This application helped my understanding of how to make successful api calls based off of models set up to create the MongoDB database. This eliminates the need to hard code user information in a seeds file for example. It was also very helpful to have the ability to view database documents on MongoDB's Compass gui.
